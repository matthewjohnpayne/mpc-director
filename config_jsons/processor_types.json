    "description"   :  "Defining the different types of processing operations we expect/allow to exist.\n The *single* field is attempting to indicate whether the processor type handles single tracklets (if true) or clusters (if false).\n The *async* field is attempting to indicate whether this type of job is performed asyncronosly (by some process that is external to the db): If so, then we allow the proc_type/job_type field in the tracklet_queue / cluster_queue tables to be set to this type. If async = false, they are just db-update jobs, requiring no async-queuing.\n The *terminate* field is attempting to indicate whether this is a terminal processing step (if true), or whether additional tasks will subsequently be required.s",
